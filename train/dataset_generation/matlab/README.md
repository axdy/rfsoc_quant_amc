# MATLAB Generating Mod Schemes

These files use the MATLAB Communications Toolbox to generate the modulated signals and to apply distortions to the signals.

## Instructions
1. Run the `loopSNRs.m` and wait until the files have been generated.
2. Run the dict_build.py file to create `transmit_{mod}_SNRs.pkl`.
